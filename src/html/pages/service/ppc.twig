        <h3>PPC Solution</h3>
        <p class="d-service-text">
            In order to generate instant sales for your startup, the best solution would be Pay-Per-Click (PPC) or Paid Advertising option.
            <br><br>
            Paid-for ads would usually appear on top of the organic search results. However, most users would still prefer to choose the organic search results from the list. Based on this user behavior pattern, we encourage companies to use both PPC ads in combination with organic search engine marketing, so that your website appears in most searches and as a result, reaching the most of your potential customers.
            <br><br>
            By using the PPC advertising, your business will have a quicker chance to reach out to your potential customers. The organic search engine marketing, in turn, will take a number of months to overtake the PPC advertisement, as the latter tend to start working instantly. Once your business starts to take closer steps to the top of the search results, the paid-for advertisement will provide revenues in the meantime, thus keeping the growth of your company without any unnecessary delays.
